    Publish all your maps, and customize an interactive platform.
    Now Raster support with infinite zoom, Point Vectors with access to attributes, share maps by download, and much more.
    We keep improving the Layer Vector Support.
    The raster support was improved, there is no zoom limit anymore.

    The Mappia is used in many projects (csr.ufmg.br/csr/projeto/) like: the amazon worth evaluation (csr.ufmg.br/amazones), and fire risk areas identification in real time in Brazilian cerrado (csr.ufmg.br/fipcerrado).
    _
    We developed an simplified WMS map protocol, as part of a 4 years research, to serve the maps over any File Storage service. Just create a FREE GitHub account and start sharing your maps online today. This platform allows the customization of the map interactions and layout in an user friendly interface.
